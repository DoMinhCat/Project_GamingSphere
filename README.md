Welcome to Gaming Sphere, the annual project as part of our training at ESGI Paris, a school of computer engineering. This project aims to put our web development skills into practice by creating a dynamic website "from scratch" without a CMS.
# Gaming Sphere - Social Network for Gamers

## Project Description

Gaming Sphere is a web development project for a complete community website designed for video game enthusiasts. The main goal is to create a centralized platform where players can connect, get information, trade, and make purchases related to their favorite universe.

**The site includes the following features:**

* **Tournament System**: Users can form teams or go solo to participate in organized tournaments, earning credits exchangeable for purchases on the site.
* **Gaming News**: Regular publication of articles, announcements, and information on current video game news.
* **Discussion Forum**: A community space for discussions, questions, and sharing among players.
* **Private Messaging System**: Allows users to communicate directly with each other.
* **Betting System**: Users can stake their credits (virtual currency) on the outcomes of organized tournaments.
* **Trading Feature**: A system for trading games and skins among community members.
* **Back Office**: A dashboard where admins can manage the site.
